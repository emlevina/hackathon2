Chat with DB.
I want to say im very impressed ! 
What an excellent project.
Your back end structure is excellent, with routes,models , controllers and a db connection folder.
Your front end is also great with your components,context,providers..
Good DRY code & good job cleaning up after youself(deleted console.logs and not used variables)
This is one of the good projects this hackathon! Keep at it.
